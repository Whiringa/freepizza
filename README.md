# Free Pizza!

I haven't built anything in React for a while, so here's a pizza coupon generator. In NZ, Pizza Hut is usually always running a promotion that gives you a free regular size pizza with every purchase. The only caveat is that it requires a coupon code from submitting a boring survey from a previous purchase (LAME!!!).

The coupon is always a 5 digit number that is divisible by 3. You really want to figure that out yourself? Of course not. Make a machine do it for you.
